The unique frequency (number of complete oscillations per second) of the radiation absorbed by an atom when it undergoes such an energy change is a periodic phenomenon analogous to the swing of a pendulum and may thus be used as a time standard because this frequency is largely independent of all normal external conditions such as air pressure and magnetic fields.</p>','Standard','<p>The atomic clock is [[]].</p>',1,0),
